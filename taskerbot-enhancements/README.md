Adds a taskerbot report button to the Modtools enhanced modqueue page.

Clicking the taskerbot button will pop up a prompt, asking you for the rule number. Enter the number, close the prompt, and the script will proceed to leave distinguished comments on every checked _thing_ to trigger the taskerbot removal.

Also adds a button to your profile page, letting you easily scrub any removed comments and things from your posting history.
