UserScript for improved reporting experience on (old) reddit.

The new report UX that reddit has rolled out is an abomination. It's slow, cumbersome, unwiledly, relies on subreddit moderators to implement a "custom" report option, and ultimately just sucks.

This UserScript adds a simple button to the thing toolbar, titled `f-report` (for fast reporting).

Click `f-report`, and a text area appears. Type your report, and hit `Enter`. Your report is done! Hit `Esc` if you didn't want to actually report anything.
